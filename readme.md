# OneTuTu

A little project to test the migration from Angular 1.2 to 2.x.

![are you as confused as I am?](http://api.ning.com/files/DtcI2O2Ry7D37vrhMobxyqoLRL*Zi7fwT0YiEYtYqYoRr23YdTPN2SU9b1YbXReq-oh4pNSGrXsRFF8X2ykT0ki0M5MzqwrL/1082102413.jpeg)


## Recommended Migration Path
At ngConf 2015, Michał Gołębiowski gave a presentation outlining a migration path from Angular 1.3 to Angular 2.0.

The gist was this: 

* Upgrade to the most recent recent version of Angular
* Use the router shipping with Angular 1.4
* Upgrade to ES 6
* Upgrade to Angular 2.0
* Upgrade to TypeScript


## Steps

We're going to write a skin for Spotify in Angular 1.2 then bump to 1.3. Then onward to 1.4. Then re-write to ES6. Then take the Angular 2 plunge, probably with some TypeScript thrown in there because that's what all the examples are written in :)
